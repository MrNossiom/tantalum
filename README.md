# Tantalum

> [Tantalum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantalum) is project to bootstrap any kind of app with great defaults and configuration.

It was created to simplify the configuration process when starting a new project.
This is a very opinionated configuration that reflects my way of thinking the code.
You can submit a PR if you want to point something out or discuss with me, but, first, remember that this is my personal configuration.
