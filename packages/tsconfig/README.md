# `tsconfig`

These are base shared `tsconfig.json`s from which all other `tsconfig.json`'s inherit from.

## Shared configurations

-   `<none>` or `index.json` for base configuration, extended by all.
-   `library.json` for libraries.
-   `nextjs.json` for NextJS applications.
-   `react-library.json` for react libraries.
